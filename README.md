# Waveform Preview

*A picture of the audio before you open an editor.*

## Overview

This repository is **Waveform Preview**, an image utility. A picture of the audio before you open an editor.

You want to see if a take is clipped, not open a DAW.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## What it does

- PNG out
- Width and height
- Peak display
- wav or mp3

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
